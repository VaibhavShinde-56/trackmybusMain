#Problem Statement:
      Traveling by bus poses significant challenges for students and commuters alike.
Irregular schedules, overcrowding, traffic congestion, and unpredictable delays disrupt routines, 
causing tardiness, missed classes, stress, and wasted time.

#Proposed Solution:
      We aim to develop a real-time smart transportation system leveraging GPS and traffic 
      management data. This system will offer users precise information on bus availability and
      arrival times. Through a dedicated app, individuals can track their desired bus's current 
      location, ensuring better planning and reduced waiting times.
      The smart transportation app utilizes GPS and traffic data, empowering users to check bus
      availability and estimated arrival times at specific stops. By tracking bus locations in real time,
      the app enhances the travel experience. Moreover, an online booking feature will help 
      manage crowds and save users' time. This integrated approach not only improves efficiency 
      but also promotes environmentally friendly travel.
